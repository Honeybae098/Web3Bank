<parameter name="content"># Contract Initialization Fix Report

## Issue Description
The deposit and withdraw buttons were not functioning because the SmartBank contract was never initialized in the Web3Context. The `initializeContract` function existed but was never called automatically.

## Root Cause
- In `Web3Context.jsx`, the `initializeContract` function was defined but not called automatically
- The contract needs to be initialized when:
  1. Web3 provider is available
  2. Signer is available
  3. Network is connected
  4. User is authenticated
  5. Wallet address is available

## Solution Implemented
Added a `useEffect` hook in `Web3Context.jsx` to automatically call `initializeContract` when all required dependencies are available:

```jsx
// Auto-initialize contract when wallet is connected and authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  if (provider && signer && network && isAuthenticated && address) {
    console.log('Initializing SmartBank contract...');
    initializeContract();
  }
}, [provider, signer, network, isAuthenticated, address, initializeContract]);
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. When a user connects their wallet and authenticates, the SmartBank contract will be automatically initialized
2. The `isContractInitialized` state will be set to `true`
3. The `canTransact` permission will be granted when the contract is initialized
4. Deposit and withdraw buttons will become functional after contract initialization

## Testing
The fix has been applied and the application has been recompiled. To test:
1. Start the development server: `cd Front-End && npm start`
2. Connect a MetaMask wallet
3. Authenticate using the Web3 authentication system
4. Navigate to the Deposit or Withdraw page
5. Verify that the buttons are now functional and can interact with the SmartBank contract

## Additional Notes
- The application may show ESLint warnings about unused variables and missing dependencies
- These warnings do not affect the functionality and can be addressed in future optimizations</parameter>
