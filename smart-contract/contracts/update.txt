1. METHOD: UUPS Proxy Pattern
we are using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard).
- How it works: Instead of deploying a single contract that can never be changed, you deploy two parts:
- The Proxy (Storage): This holds the State (the actual ETH, user balances, and history). Its address never changes.
- The Implementation (Logic): This holds the Logic (the code you provided).
- The Benefit: If you want to change the interest rate from 5% to 6%, you swap the "Logic" but the "Storage" keeps all the money and history safe.


2. CORE FEATURE
- deposit: user deposit the money (
    - check dep osit amount
    - applyInterest
    - update state
)
- withdraw: user withdraw the money (
    - security:ReentrancyGuard
    - applyInterest
    - check balances with withdraw amount
    - check Bank Liquidity with withdraw amount after interest
    - update state
     )
- applyInterest (
    - interest is applied when a user trigger transaction
    - calculate per second
    - cut 10% after interest is applied (this is used as an income for the Bank)
)
- recordTransaction
